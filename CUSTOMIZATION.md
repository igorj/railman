# Customizations of the default rails application

These are the things that are different in the app template generated by railman compared to the plain app template generated by rails.

## .ruby-version

Specify your ruby version here.

## .envrc

If you install direnv, you don't have to use `bundle exec` any more, as the bin direcory is added to the PATH when you are enter the application's directory.  

## Gemfile

Add following gems: 
pg - postgres database driver
exception_notification - notify me per email on each exception
letter_opener - open emails in popup window in the browser in development mode

Remove following gems: 
sqlite3 - we are using postgres per default

Add the application-specific gems to Gemfile.local, so it can be kept separate from the base Gemfile.

## Eyefile

[Eye](https://github.com/kostya/eye) is a ruby process manager. We use it to start/stop/restart/monitor the application ruby processes. 

The configuration of the processes that the application includes (app server, workers) is in the Eyefile. 

The eye gem is not included in the Gemfile. Eye should be installed globally on the server or your local machine and there will be only one eye process that manages multiple rails applications.  

## .env.example

This is a template for the application- and server-specific .env file.  

## config/deploy/production.rb

config/deploy includes the deployment targets (production, staging, ...) 

This is the configuration capistrano uses when you invoke `cap TARGET deploy`

TODO: ask for server name on `railman new APP_NAME`

## config/environments/development.rb

## config/environments/production.rb
